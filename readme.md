Webpack + Typescript Web App Boilerplate
========================================

> Stay tuned, more coming!

A collection of what I usually use when building web apps, didnt go all out and just use webpack, reason becuase sometimes you have multiple pages and other `public` like things you want built differently, hence `gulp`ing.. 

But yeah: 
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Gulp
- Vue (integrated with TypeScript)
- Dev Server
- Production building

and more coming...

#### Setup
- `npm i webpack gulp typings -g`
- `typings i`
- `npm i`

#### Usage
- `gulp` - dev server
- `gulp build` - production build
